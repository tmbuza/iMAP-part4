   abstract = {Background: One of the major challenges facing investigators in the microbiome field is turning large numbers of reads generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms into biological knowledge. Effective analytical workflows that guarantee reproducibility, repeatability, and result provenance are essential requirements of modern microbiome research. For nearly a decade, several state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools have been developed for understanding microbial communities living in a given sample. However, most of these tools are built with many functions that require an in-depth understanding of their implementation and the choice of additional tools for visualizing the final output. Furthermore, microbiome analysis can be time-consuming and may even require more advanced programming skills which some investigators may be lacking. Results: We have developed a wrapper named iMAP (Integrated Microbiome Analysis Pipeline) to provide the microbiome research community with a user-friendly and portable tool that integrates bioinformatics analysis and data visualization. The iMAP tool wraps functionalities for metadata profiling, quality control of reads, sequence processing and classification, and diversity analysis of operational taxonomic units. This pipeline is also capable of generating web-based progress reports for enhancing an approach referred to as review-as-you-go (RAYG). For the most part, the profiling of microbial community is done using functionalities implemented in Mothur or QIIME2 platform. Also, it uses different R packages for graphics and R-markdown for generating progress reports. We have used a case study to demonstrate the application of the iMAP pipeline. Conclusions: The iMAP pipeline integrates several functionalities for better identification of microbial communities present in a given sample. The pipeline performs in-depth quality control that guarantees high-quality results and accurate conclusions. The vibrant visuals produced by the pipeline facilitate a better understanding of the complex and multidimensional microbiome data. The integrated RAYG approach enables the generation of web-based reports, which provides the investigators with the intermediate output that can be reviewed progressively. The intensively analyzed case study set a model for microbiome data analysis.},

In this article we propose an event labeling system relying on an ensemble of detectors and background knowledge. The target data are the usage log of a real bike sharing system. We first label events in the data and then evaluate the performance of the ensemble and individual detectors on the labeled data set using ROC analysis and static evaluation metrics in the absence and presence of background knowledge. Our results show that when there is no access to human experts, the proposed approach can be an effective alternative for labeling events. In addition to the main proposal, we conduct a comparative study regarding the various predictive models performance, semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches, train data scale, time series filtering methods, online and offline predictive models, and distance functions in measuring time series similarity.},

   abstract = {Differential abundance (DA) analysis of microbiome data continues to be a challenging problem due to the complexity of the data. In this article we define the notion of “sampling fraction” and demonstrate a major hurdle in performing DA analysis of microbiome data is the bias introduced by differences in the sampling fractions across samples. We introduce a methodology called Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes with Bias Correction (ANCOM-BC), which estimates the unknown sampling fractions and corrects the bias induced by their differences among samples. The absolute abundance data are modeled using a linear regression framework. This formulation makes a fundamental advancement in the field because, unlike the existing methods, it (a) provides statistically valid test with appropriate p-values, (b) provides confidence intervals for differential abundance of each taxon, (c) controls the False Discovery Rate (FDR), (d) maintains adequate power, and (e) is computationally simple to implement. Differential abundance analysis of microbiome data continues to be challenging due to data complexity. The authors propose a method which estimates the unknown sampling fractions and corrects the bias induced by their differences among samples.},

   abstract = {Background: Data from 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing present challenges to ecological and statistical interpretation. In particular, library sizes often vary over several ranges of magnitude, and the data contains many zeros. Although we are typically interested in comparing relative abundance of taxa in the ecosystem of two or more groups, we can only measure the taxon relative abundance in specimens obtained from the ecosystems. Because the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the specimen is not equivalent to the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the ecosystems, this presents a special challenge. Second, because the relative abundance of taxa in the specimen (as well as in the ecosystem) sum to 1, these are compositional data. Because the compositional data are constrained by the simplex (sum to 1) and are not unconstrained in the Euclidean space, many standard methods of analysis are not applicable. Here, we evaluate how these challenges impact the performance of existing normalization methods and differential abundance analyses. Results: Effects on normalization: Most normalization methods enable successful clustering of samples according to biological origin when the groups differ substantially in their overall microbial composition. Rarefying more clearly clusters samples according to biological origin than other normalization techniques do for ordination metrics based on presence or absence. Alternate normalization measures are potentially vulnerable to artifacts due to library size. Effects on differential abundance testing: We build on a previous work to evaluate seven proposed statistical methods using rarefied as well as raw data. Our simulation studies suggest that the false discovery rates of many differential abundance-testing methods are not increased by rarefying itself, although of course rarefying results in a loss of sensitivity due to elimination of a portion of available data. For groups with large (~10×) differences in the average library size, rarefying lowers the false discovery rate. DESeq2, without addition of a constant, increased sensitivity on smaller datasets (< 20 samples per group) but tends towards a higher false discovery rate with more samples, very uneven (~10×) library sizes, and/or compositional effects. For drawing inferences regarding taxon abundance in the ecosystem, analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) is not only very sensitive (for > 20 samples per group) but also critically the only method tested that has a good control of false discovery rate. Conclusions: These findings guide which normalization and differential abundance techniques to use based on the data characteristics of a given study.},

There is increasing awareness that microbiome datasets generated by HTS are compositional because they have an arbitrary total imposed by the instrument. However, many investigators are either unaware of this or assume specific properties of the compositional data. The purpose of this review is to alert investigators to the dangers inherent in ignoring the compositional nature of the data, and point out that HTS datasets derived from microbiome studies can and should be treated as compositions at all stages of analysis. We briefly introduce compositional data, illustrate the pathologies that occur when compositional data are analyzed inappropriately, and finally give guidance and point to resources and examples for the analysis of microbiome datasets using compositional data analysis.},

abstract = {This article documents the continued gender disparities evident across U.S. higher education. While more women than men attend college and now obtain the majority of undergraduate, master's, and doctoral degrees, women continue to be underrepresented in senior-level institutional leadership roles. This phenomenon is particularly evident among the member institutions of the Council for Christian Colleges {\&} Universities (CCCU). Given that the CCCU's 108 U.S. member campuses serve a collective student body that is more than 60{\%} female, such gender imbalances are striking, especially noting the commitment of Christ-centered campuses to foster organizational climates that value diversity and promote the success and well-being of all students. Data over a 12-year period (1998-2010) have been collected to document trends in the gender composition of the senior-level leadership teams on these campuses. Over that period, the average number of individuals serving at vice presidential or higher levels across these institutions increased from 5.3 to 5.9. The percent of men grew 20{\%} over the period, while the percent of women serving on those leadership teams grew 161{\%}-from 8.4{\%} to 17{\%} of the total serving in these senior leadership positions. On average across these campuses, the mean of male senior leaders in 2010 was 4.9; the mean of women serving was just under 1.0 (.99). The background, results, and discussion/implications sections present trends and themes related to the composition of CCCU presidents' leadership teams, with suggestions offered for changing the face of senior leadership in member institutions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Metagenome studies are becoming increasingly widespread, yielding important insights into microbial communities covering diverse environments from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to human skin and gut. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing platforms, the use of large scale shotgun sequencing approaches is now commonplace. However, a thorough independent benchmark comparing state-of-the-art metagenome analysis tools is lacking. Here, we present a benchmark where the most widely used tools are tested on complex, realistic data sets. Our results clearly show that the most widely used tools are not necessarily the most accurate, that the most accurate tool is not necessarily the most time consuming, and that there is a high degree of variability between available tools. These findings are important as the conclusions of any metagenomics study are affected by errors in the predicted community composition and functional capacity.

abstract = {Studies of the human microbiome have revealed that even healthy individuals differ remarkably in the microbes that occupy habitats such as the gut, skin and vagina. Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics and early microbial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analysed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat's signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81-99{\%} of the genera, enzyme families and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human microbiome. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Bushmeat, the meat and organs derived from wildlife species, is a common source of animal protein in the diets of those living in sub-Saharan Africa and is frequently associated with zoonotic spillover of dangerous pathogens. Given the frequent consumption of bushmeat in this region and the lack of knowledge about the microbial communities associated with this meat, the microbiome of 56 fresh and processed bushmeat samples ascertained from three districts in the Western Serengeti ecosystem in Tanzania was characterized using 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing. The results show that the most abundant phyla present in bushmeat samples include Firmicutes (67.8{\%}), Proteobacteria (18.4{\%}), Cyanobacteria (8.9{\%}), and Bacteroidetes (3.1{\%}). Regardless of wildlife species, sample condition, season, or region, the microbiome is diverse across all samples, with no significant difference in alpha or beta diversity. The findings also suggest the presence of DNA signatures of potentially dangerous zoonotic pathogens, including those from the genus Bacillus, Brucella, Coxiella, and others, in bushmeat. Together, this investigation provides a better understanding of the microbiome associated with this major food source in samples collected from the Western Serengeti in Tanzania and highlights a need for future investigations on the potential health risks associated with the harvesting, trade, and consumption of bushmeat in Sub-Saharan Africa.},

abstract = {In this conceptual paper, we draw upon the insights of Feminist Science Studies, in particular Karen Barad's concept of agential realism, as a critical analytical tool to re-think nature and culture binaries in dominant science knowledge-making practices and explanatory accounts, and their possible implications for science education in the context of socio-spatial and environmental injustices. Barad's framework proposes a relational and more expansive approach to justice, which takes into account consequential effects of nature-culture practices on humans, non-humans, and more than human vitalities. In efforts to understand potentialities of Barad's theory of agential realism, we situate our argument in the “story” of local children who encounter a bottle of cyanide in a former manufacturing building. The story takes place in a post-industrial urban city located in the U.S., caught up in an inverse relationship between the technological and scientific advances observed “globally” and the deteriorating environmental and living conditions experienced “locally” as the result of erstwhile industrial activity. Based on agential realist readings of the story and taking into consideration children's developing subjectivities, we argue that equity-oriented scholarship in science education might not be able to achieve justice devoid of understanding of the relatedness to plurality of life forms. We invite our readers to consider (re)configuring socio-spatial and environmental issues as an ethical response-ability that is constituted through relationships of care, recognition, openness, and responsiveness to vitalities of humans and nonhumans equally, one which cannot be conceptualized from a priori and distant calculations, but rather continuous entangled relations.},

abstract = {Microbiome studies often aim to predict outcomes or differentiate samples based on their microbial compositions, tasks that can be efficiently performed by supervised learning methods. Here we present a benchmark comparison of supervised learning classifiers and regressors implemented in scikit-learn, a Python-based machine-learning library. We additionally present q2-sample-classifier, a plugin for the QIIME 2 microbiome bioinformatics framework, that facilitates application of the scikit-learn classifiers to microbiome data. Random forest, extra trees, and gradient boosting models demonstrate the highest performance for both supervised classification and regression of microbiome data. Automated feature selection and hyperparameter tuning enhance performance of most methods but may not be necessary under all circumstances. The q2-sample-classifier plugin makes these methods more accessible and interpretable to a broad audience of microbiologists, clinicians, and others who wish to utilize supervised learning methods for predicting sample characteristics based on microbiome composition. The q2-sample-classifier source code is available at https://github.com/qiime2/q2-sample-classifier.

abstract = {Background: One of the major challenges facing investigators in the microbiome field is turning large numbers of reads generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms into biological knowledge. Effective analytical workflows that guarantee reproducibility, repeatability, and result provenance are essential requirements of modern microbiome research. For nearly a decade, several state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools have been developed for understanding microbial communities living in a given sample. However, most of these tools are built with many functions that require an in-depth understanding of their implementation and the choice of additional tools for visualizing the final output. Furthermore, microbiome analysis can be time-consuming and may even require more advanced programming skills which some investigators may be lacking. Results: We have developed a wrapper named iMAP (Integrated Microbiome Analysis Pipeline) to provide the microbiome research community with a user-friendly and portable tool that integrates bioinformatics analysis and data visualization. The iMAP tool wraps functionalities for metadata profiling, quality control of reads, sequence processing and classification, and diversity analysis of operational taxonomic units. This pipeline is also capable of generating web-based progress reports for enhancing an approach referred to as review-as-you-go (RAYG). For the most part, the profiling of microbial community is done using functionalities implemented in Mothur or QIIME2 platform. Also, it uses different R packages for graphics and R-markdown for generating progress reports. We have used a case study to demonstrate the application of the iMAP pipeline. Conclusions: The iMAP pipeline integrates several functionalities for better identification of microbial communities present in a given sample. The pipeline performs in-depth quality control that guarantees high-quality results and accurate conclusions. The vibrant visuals produced by the pipeline facilitate a better understanding of the complex and multidimensional microbiome data. The integrated RAYG approach enables the generation of web-based reports, which provides the investigators with the intermediate output that can be reviewed progressively. The intensively analyzed case study set a model for microbiome data analysis.},

When amplicons for multiple markers such as the 16S rRNA gene hypervariable regions are available, MetAmp improves the accuracy of OTU-based methods for characterizing bacterial composition and community structure. MetAmp works best with at least three markers, and is applicable to non-bacterial analyses and to non 16S markers. Our application and testing have been limited to 16S analysis of microbial communities. RESULTS: We clustered standard test sequences derived from the Human Microbiome Mock Community test sets and compared MetAmp and other tools with respect to their ability to recover OTUs for these benchmark bacterial communities. MetAmp compared favorably to QIIME, UPARSE and Mothur using amplicons from one, two, and three markers. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MetAmp is available at http://izhbannikov.github.io/MetAmp/.},

Opportunities for improvement continue to accelerate, with greater access to multi-omics, microbial reference genomes, and strain-level diversity. To leverage these, we present bioBakery 3, a set of integrated, improved methods for taxonomic, strain-level, functional, and phylogenetic profiling of metagenomes newly developed to build on the largest set of reference sequences now available. Compared to current alternatives, MetaPhlAn 3 increases the accuracy of taxonomic profiling, and HUMAnN 3 improves that of functional potential and activity. These methods detected novel disease-microbiome links in applications to CRC (1262 metagenomes) and IBD (1635 metagenomes and 817 metatranscriptomes). Strain-level profiling of an additional 4077 metagenomes with StrainPhlAn 3 and PanPhlAn 3 unraveled the phylogenetic and functional structure of the common gut microbe Ruminococcus bromii, previously described by only 15 isolate genomes. With open-source implementations and cloud-deployable reproducible workflows, the bioBakery 3 platform can help researchers deepen the resolution, scale, and accuracy of multi-omic profiling for microbial community studies.},

abstract = {Motivation Widespread interest in the study of the microbiome has resulted in data proliferation and the development of powerful computational tools. However, many scientific researchers lack the time, training, or infrastructure to work with large datasets or to install and use command line tools. Results The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has created Nephele, a cloud-based microbiome data analysis platform with standardized pipelines and a simple web interface for transforming raw data into biological insights. Nephele integrates common microbiome analysis tools as well as valuable reference datasets like the healthy human subjects cohort of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). Nephele is built on the Amazon Web Services cloud, which provides centralized and automated storage and compute capacity, thereby reducing the burden on researchers and their institutions.},

abstract = {Background: Liver disease is common in HIV infection and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Elevated ferritin, the iron storage protein, and hepatic deposition of iron, has been previously found to be associated with advanced liver fibrosis. Because of sampling variability with liver biopsy and the patchiness of hepatic iron deposition, MRI provides better assessment of liver iron, while Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) has a high diagnostic accuracy for assessing hepatic fibrosis. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between liver fibrosis, iron status and serum ferritin in HIV infected and non-infected adults. Methods: After consenting 37 HIV seropositive and 31 HIV/ HBV/HCV seronegative participants from the MASH cohort, demographics were collected and blood was drawn for serum ferritin. MRE and MRI was conducted on a 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma MRI and mean stiffness of the liver was calculated through an inversion algorithm that generates elastogram/stiffness maps of the tissue in kilopascals. The transverse relaxation rate (R2∗) was measured through Siemens LiverLab using a multi-echo Dixon VIBE image based software. Results: The median age was 54 years (IQR: 50-59), 50{\%} were women and 62.16{\%} were African American. The HIV infected group had higher mean liver stiffness (P=0.032), higher liver iron status (R2∗) (P=0.001), and higher serum ferritin levels (P=0.001) as compared to uninfected participants. Mean liver stiffness and liver iron status (R2∗) were correlated with serum ferritin (r=0.379, P=0.023; r=0.360, P=0.031, respectively) in the HIV infected group only. In a linear regression model, participants with HIV had a significant relationship between R2∗ and ferritin levels ($\beta$=0.150, SE=0.070, P=0.040), adjusting for age and gender. This relationship was not found in the HIV seronegative group. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that there may be increased deposition of iron in the liver in HIV mono-infected adults. While there was an increase in liver stiffness with the MRE measurement, the iron status suggests iron may be the source of the higher liver stiffness. The availability of non-invasive, accurate measure of liver disease progression is important, suggesting a role for iron status in liver disease pathogenesis as a potential therapeutic target in a high-risk population such as those with HIV infection.},

abstract = {Background: Magnetic Resonance elastography (MRE) is a non-invasive, highly accurate method to assess hepatic fibrosis which is needed for therapeutic decisions or predicting disease outcomes. Studies to date have reported contradictory results regarding association between HIV mono-infection and liver fibrosis, possibly due to the difficulty in obtaining liver biopsies and using less accurate non-invasive indicators of liver disease in this population. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between the extent of liver fibrosis in HIV mono-infected and non-infected adults. Methods: After consenting 176 HIV mono-infected and 113 HIV/HBV/HCV un-infected adults from the Miami Adult Studies in HIV (MASH) cohort, demographics were collected. CD4 cell count and HIV viral load was obtained from medical charts. Controlled HIV viral load was defined as having {\textless}400 copies/mL. MRE was conducted on a 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma MRI and mean stiffness of the liver was calculated through an inversion algorithm that generates elastogram/stiffness maps of the tissue in kilopascals. Statistical analyses were completed using frequencies, Wilcoxon Two-Sample test and regression models. Results: The median age was 54 years (IQR: 49-59), 54.55{\%} were male and 67.16{\%} were African American. In those with HIV, 11{\%} had detectable HIV viral load. Within the group infected with HIV, those who had undetectable HIV viral load had lower mean liver stiffness compared to those with detectable HIV viral load [2.266 kPa (IQR=2.480-1.970) vs. 2.237 kPa (IQR=2.450-1.950), P=0.025). Those who had detectable HIV viral load had a significantly higher mean liver stiffness compared to the uninfected group [2.691 kPa (IQR=3.080-2.180) vs. 2.237 kPa (IQR=2.450-1.950), P=0.024]. In a regression analysis, those with detectable HIV viral load had significantly higher mean liver stiffness ($\beta$=0.389, SE=0.180, P=0.033) after controlling for age, BMI, and CD4 cell count. Conclusion: MRE, an accurate, non-invasive method to detect liver fibrosis in a cohort of HIV infected and HIV/HBV/HCV uninfected adults, shows that detectable HIV viral load is associated with more advanced liver fibrosis than when HIV viral load is undetectable or when patients are not infected. These results indicate a deleterious effect of the HIV virus on the liver and confirm earlier reported analyses using FIB-4 to estimate liver fibrosis in similar cohorts.},

Evaluate the barriers and the facilitators for reproductive decision-making. Identify areas of strength, improvement, and those requiring further research. Design and data sources Systematic review following the PRISMA guideline. PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, SocINDEX, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched from 1985 to 2016 using the following Keywords: HIV, AIDS, pregnancy, reproduction, and decision-making. Study selection A total of 42 research papers were included in this review. Initially, 1563 papers were identified for the review by database (n = 1544) and hand (n = 19) searches. With three review levels, 1521 papers were excluded (title review, n = 1272; abstract review, n = 136; and full paper review, n = 113). Studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals using both quantitative and qualitative methods and addressing reproductive decisions in women living with HIV were included. Thirdly, inclusion eligibility was assessed by title, abstract, and full text. Review methods Random allocation conducted by the primary researcher assigned an equal number of papers to each researcher for review, including detailed instructions with an abstraction form. Discrepancies were resolved by two researchers. Research quality was assessed using the NCHBL Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies, the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for the qualitative studies and its version for systematic reviews Results The review included 42 papers, both quantitative (n = 24) and qualitative methods (n = 14). Most studies were completed by physicians (n = 16) or nurses (n = 15). More than two-thirds of the studies were performed in urban settings with predominantly African-American women (n = 27). Eight factors were identified as influencing the reproductive decision-making process in women living with HIV: ‘Socio-demographic, Health status and Pregnancy', ‘Religion and spirituality', ‘Beliefs and Attitudes about Antiretroviral Therapy', ‘Healthcare providers', ‘Significant others', ‘Motherhood and fulfillment', ‘Fear of perinatal infection and infection of partner(s)', ‘Birth control and pregnancy management'. Conclusions Health care providers are not providing patient-centered care by applying scientific evidence to their practice when advising women with HIV in making reproductive decisions. Despite the strong evidence indicating pregnancy for women with HIV results in a safe birthing trajectory, one not likely to jeopardize the health of the either the mother or fetus, providers continue to recommend the women with HIV avoid pregnancy and neglect to invite partners to participate in the discussion.},

Drug use has been linked to increased risk for HIV, but little is known about the uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV among women who use drugs (WWUD). Following the PRISMA guideline, we conducted a multi-database literature search to assess engagement along the PrEP care continuum among WWUD in the U.S. Seven studies with a total of 755 women were included in the review: 370 (49{\%}) Black, 126 (16.7{\%}) Hispanics, and 259 (34.3{\%}) Whites. Employing random-effect models, data indicate 20.6{\%} (95{\%} CI 8.7{\%}, 32.4{\%}) of WWUD were aware of PrEP, and 60.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 52.2{\%}, 68.2{\%}) of those aware were also willing to use PrEP. Notwithstanding study limitations, our findings suggest there may be potential to increase PrEP uptake among WWUD, but efforts must first concentrate on improving PrEP awareness among this population.},

In this Review, we discuss the best practices for performing a microbiome study, including experimental design, choice of molecular analysis technology, methods for data analysis and the integration of multiple omics data sets. We focus on recent findings that suggest that operational taxonomic unit-based analyses should be replaced with new methods that are based on exact sequence variants, methods for integrating metagenomic and metabolomic data, and issues surrounding compositional data analysis, where advances have been particularly rapid. We note that although some of these approaches are new, it is important to keep sight of the classic issues that arise during experimental design and relate to research reproducibility. We describe how keeping these issues in mind allows researchers to obtain more insight from their microbiome data sets.},

abstract = {Background: One of the major challenges facing investigators in the microbiome field is turning large numbers of reads generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms into biological knowledge. Effective analytical workflows that guarantee reproducibility, repeatability, and result provenance are essential requirements of modern microbiome research. For nearly a decade, several state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools have been developed for understanding microbial communities living in a given sample. However, most of these tools are built with many functions that require an in-depth understanding of their implementation and the choice of additional tools for visualizing the final output. Furthermore, microbiome analysis can be time-consuming and may even require more advanced programming skills which some investigators may be lacking. Results: We have developed a wrapper named iMAP (Integrated Microbiome Analysis Pipeline) to provide the microbiome research community with a user-friendly and portable tool that integrates bioinformatics analysis and data visualization. The iMAP tool wraps functionalities for metadata profiling, quality control of reads, sequence processing and classification, and diversity analysis of operational taxonomic units. This pipeline is also capable of generating web-based progress reports for enhancing an approach referred to as review-as-you-go (RAYG). For the most part, the profiling of microbial community is done using functionalities implemented in Mothur or QIIME2 platform. Also, it uses different R packages for graphics and R-markdown for generating progress reports. We have used a case study to demonstrate the application of the iMAP pipeline. Conclusions: The iMAP pipeline integrates several functionalities for better identification of microbial communities present in a given sample. The pipeline performs in-depth quality control that guarantees high-quality results and accurate conclusions. The vibrant visuals produced by the pipeline facilitate a better understanding of the complex and multidimensional microbiome data. The integrated RAYG approach enables the generation of web-based reports, which provides the investigators with the intermediate output that can be reviewed progressively.

abstract = {Hill numbers (or the effective number of species) have been increasingly used to quantify the species/taxonomic diversity of an assemblage. The sample-size- and coverage-based integrations of rarefaction (interpolation) and extrapolation (prediction) of Hill numbers represent a unified standardization method for quantifying and comparing species diversity across multiple assemblages. We briefly review the conceptual background of Hill numbers along with two approaches to standardization. We present an R package iNEXT (iNterpolation/EXTrapolation) which provides simple functions to compute and plot the seamless rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves for the three most widely used members of the Hill number family (species richness, Shannon diversity and Simpson diversity). Two types of biodiversity data are allowed: individual-based abundance data and sampling-unit-based incidence data. Several applications of the iNEXT packages are reviewed: (i) Non-asymptotic analysis: comparison of diversity estimates for equally large or equally complete samples. (ii) Asymptotic analysis: comparison of estimated asymptotic or true diversities. (iii) Assessment of sample completeness (sample coverage) across multiple samples. (iv) Comparison of estimated point diversities for a specified sample size or a specified level of sample coverage.

abstract = {Ecologists hypothesize that community structure and stability affect productivity, sensitivity to invasion and extinction, and resilience and resistance to perturbations. Viewed in the context of the gut microbiome, the stability of the gut community is important for understanding the effects of antibiotics, diet change and other perturbations on host health and colonization resistance. Here we describe the dynamics of a self-contained community, the murine gut microbiome. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples collected daily from individual mice, we characterized the community membership and structure to determine whether there were significant changes in the gut community during the first year of life. Based on analysis of molecular variance, we observed two community states. The first was observed in the 10 days following weaning and the second was observed by 15 days following weaning. Interestingly, these two states had the same bacterial populations, but those populations had different relative abundances in the two states. By calculating the root mean squared distances between samples collected in the early and late states for each mouse, we observed that the late state was more stable than the early state. This increase in stability was not correlated with increased taxonomic richness, taxonomic diversity, or phylogenetic diversity. In the absence of an experimentally induced perturbation, the second community state was relatively constant through 364 days post weaning. These results suggest a high degree of stability in the microbiome once the community reached the second state.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: As microbial ecologists take advantage of high-throughput sequencing technologies to describe microbial communities across ever-increasing numbers of samples, new analysis tools are required to relate the distribution of microbes among larger numbers of communities, and to use increasingly rich and standards-compliant metadata to understand the biological factors driving these relationships. In particular, the Earth Microbiome Project drives these needs by profiling the genomic content of tens of thousands of samples across multiple environment types. FINDINGS: Features of EMPeror include: ability to visualize gradients and categorical data, visualize different principal coordinates axes, present the data in the form of parallel coordinates, show taxa as well as environmental samples, dynamically adjust the size and transparency of the spheres representing the communities on a per-category basis, dynamically scale the axes according to the fraction of variance each explains, show, hide or recolor points according to arbitrary metadata including that compliant with the MIxS family of standards developed by the Genomic Standards Consortium, display jackknifed-resampled data to assess statistical confidence in clustering, perform coordinate comparisons (useful for procrustes analysis plots), and greatly reduce loading times and overall memory footprint compared with existing approaches. Additionally, ease of sharing, given EMPeror's small output file size, enables agile collaboration by allowing users to embed these visualizations via emails or web pages without the need for extra plugins. CONCLUSIONS: Here we present EMPeror, an open source and web browser enabled tool with a versatile command line interface that allows researchers to perform rapid exploratory investigations of 3D visualizations of microbial community data, such as the widely used principal coordinates plots. EMPeror includes a rich set of controllers to modify features as a function of the metadata. By being specifically tailored to the requirements of microbial ecologists, EMPeror thus increases the speed with which insight can be gained from large microbiome datasets.},

abstract = {Total genomic DNA from samples of intact mouse small intestine, large intestine, caecum and faeces was used as template for PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene sequences with conserved bacterial primers. Phylogenetic analysis of the amplification products revealed 40 unique 16S rDNA sequences. Of these sequences, 25{\%} (10/40) corresponded to described intestinal organisms of the mouse, including Lactobacillus spp., Helicobacter spp., segmented filamentous bacteria and members of the altered Schaedler flora (ASF360, ASF361, ASF502 and ASF519); 75{\%} (30/40) represented novel sequences. A large number (11/40) of the novel sequences revealed a new operational taxonomic unit (OTU) belonging to the Cytophaga-Flavobacter-Bacteroides phylum, which the authors named 'mouse intestinal bacteria'. 16S rRNA probes were developed for this new OTU. Upon analysis of the novel sequences, eight were found to cluster within the Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides group and three clustered within the Bacteroides group. One of the novel sequences was distantly related to Verrucomicrobium spinosum and one was distantly related to Bacillus mycoides. Oligonucleotide probes specific for the 16S rRNA of these novel clones were generated. Using a combination of four previously described and four newly designed probes, approximately 80{\%} of bacteria recovered from the murine large intestine and 71{\%} of bacteria recovered from the murine caecum could be identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our view of host-associated microbiota remains incomplete due to the presence of as yet uncultured constituents. The Bacteroidales family S24-7 is a prominent example of one of these groups. Marker gene surveys indicate that members of this family are highly localized to the gastrointestinal tracts of homeothermic animals and are increasingly being recognized as a numerically predominant member of the gut microbiota; however, little is known about the nature of their interactions with the host. RESULTS: Here, we provide the first whole genome exploration of this family, for which we propose the name "Candidatus Homeothermaceae," using 30 population genomes extracted from fecal samples of four different animal hosts: human, mouse, koala, and guinea pig. We infer the core metabolism of "Ca. Homeothermaceae" to be that of fermentative or nanaerobic bacteria, resembling that of related Bacteroidales families. In addition, we describe three trophic guilds within the family, plant glycan (hemicellulose and pectin), host glycan, and alpha-glucan, each broadly defined by increased abundance of enzymes involved in the degradation of particular carbohydrates. CONCLUSIONS: "Ca. Homeothermaceae" representatives constitute a substantial component of the murine gut microbiota, as well as being present within the human gut, and this study provides important first insights into the nature of their residency. The presence of trophic guilds within the family indicates the potential for niche partitioning and specific roles for each guild in gut health and dysbiosis.},

abstract = {Intestinal bacteria influence mammalian physiology, but many types of bacteria are still uncharacterized. Moreover, reference strains of mouse gut bacteria are not easily available, although mouse models are extensively used in medical research. These are major limitations for the investigation of intestinal microbiomes and their interactions with diet and host. It is thus important to study in detail the diversity and functions of gut microbiota members, including those colonizing the mouse intestine. To address these issues, we aimed at establishing the Mouse Intestinal Bacterial Collection (miBC), a public repository of bacterial strains and associated genomes from the mouse gut, and studied host-specificity of colonization and sequence-based relevance of the resource. The collection includes several strains representing novel species, genera and even one family. Genomic analyses showed that certain species are specific to the mouse intestine and that a minimal consortium of 18 strains covered 50-75{\%} of the known functional potential of metagenomes. The present work will sustain future research on microbiota-host interactions in health and disease, as it will facilitate targeted colonization and molecular studies. The resource is available at www.dsmz.de/miBC.},

abstract = {Rapid advances in sequencing technology have changed the experimental landscape of microbial ecology. In the last 10 years, the field has moved from sequencing hundreds of 16S rRNA gene fragments per study using clone libraries to the sequencing of millions of fragments per study using next-generation sequencing technologies from 454 and Illumina. As these technologies advance, it is critical to assess the strengths, weaknesses, and overall suitability of these platforms for the interrogation of microbial communities. Here, we present an improved method for sequencing variable regions within the 16S rRNA gene using Illumina's MiSeq platform, which is currently capable of producing paired 250-nucleotide reads. We evaluated three overlapping regions of the 16S rRNA gene that vary in length (i.e., V34, V4, and V45) by resequencing a mock community and natural samples from human feces, mouse feces, and soil. By titrating the concentration of 16S rRNA gene amplicons applied to the flow cell and using a quality score-based approach to correct discrepancies between reads used to construct contigs, we were able to reduce error rates by as much as two orders of magnitude. Finally, we reprocessed samples from a previous study to demonstrate that large numbers of samples could be multiplexed and sequenced in parallel with shotgun metagenomes. These analyses demonstrate that our approach can provide data that are at least as good as that generated by the 454 platform while providing considerably higher sequencing coverage for a fraction of the cost.},

Neighbor joining (NJ) is a widely used distance-based phylogenetic tree construction method that has historically been considered fast, but it is prohibitively slow for building trees from increasingly large datasets. We developed a fast variant of NJ called relaxed neighbor joining (RNJ) and performed experiments to measure the speed improvement over NJ. Since repeated runs of the RNJ algorithm generate a superset of the trees that repeated NJ runs generate, we also assessed tree quality. RNJ is dramatically faster than NJ, and the quality of resulting trees is very similar for the two algorithms. The results indicate that RNJ is a reasonable alternative to NJ and that it is especially well suited for uses that involve large numbers of taxa or highly repetitive procedures such as bootstrapping.},

@article{Mandal2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the factors regulating our microbiota is important but requires appropriate statistical methodology. When comparing two or more populations most existing approaches either discount the underlying compositional structure in the microbiome data or use probability models such as the multinomial and Dirichlet-multinomial distributions, which may impose a correlation structure not suitable for microbiome data. OBJECTIVE: To develop a methodology that accounts for compositional constraints to reduce false discoveries in detecting differentially abundant taxa at an ecosystem level, while maintaining high statistical power. METHODS: We introduced a novel statistical framework called analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM). ANCOM accounts for the underlying structure in the data and can be used for comparing the composition of microbiomes in two or more populations. ANCOM makes no distributional assumptions and can be implemented in a linear model framework to adjust for covariates as well as model longitudinal data. ANCOM also scales well to compare samples involving thousands of taxa. RESULTS: We compared the performance of ANCOM to the standard t-test and a recently published methodology called Zero Inflated Gaussian (ZIG) methodology (1) for drawing inferences on the mean taxa abundance in two or more populations. ANCOM controlled the false discovery rate (FDR) at the desired nominal level while also improving power, whereas the t-test and ZIG had inflated FDRs, in some instances as high as 68{\%} for the t-test and 60{\%} for ZIG. We illustrate the performance of ANCOM using two publicly available microbial datasets in the human gut, demonstrating its general applicability to testing hypotheses about compositional differences in microbial communities. CONCLUSION: Accounting for compositionality using log-ratio analysis results in significantly improved inference in microbiota survey data.},

abstract = {Ticks vector diverse pathogenic bacteria that are important to identify in public health and veterinary contexts. Technological advances in high throughput sequencing have given an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively characterize bacterial associates of ticks, but recent studies have used different 16S rRNA variable regions and sequence read lengths with little consideration of whether they reveal the same bacterial diversity. We compare the effectiveness of bacterial surveys using three library preparations across nine 16S variable regions and a set of 12 tick specimens (Acari: Ixodidae). We identify the bacterial assemblages present in extractions from wild-collected Ixodes scapularis from two regions of Canada, and provide the first microbiome survey for Ixodes angustus. Four bacterial families accounted for most diversity, with Rickettsiaceae being replaced as most common by Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonadaceae in some I. scapularis, and Francisellaceae being most abundant in I. angustus. The commercially available Ion 16S kit, based on 6 amplicons representing 16S regions V2, V3, V4, V67, V8 and V9, gave the most comprehensive estimates of bacterial families, with the Ion V4 amplicon generally giving the highest estimated diversity. Sequencing of the V4 amplicon by the MR DNA commercial service also provided cost effective assays of tick microbiomes that were within the range of results from the Ion 16S kit. Subtraction of the number of reads found in an extraction control sample lowered estimates of the number of bacterial families by approximately half. Our study shows that diversity patterns obtained from 16S microbiome surveys depend on the amplicon and protocol used, demonstrating that more than one marker region is needed to provide reliable inferences.},

@article{Gao2017,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Species-level classification for 16S rRNA gene sequences remains a serious challenge for microbiome researchers, because existing taxonomic classification tools for 16S rRNA gene sequences either do not provide species-level classification, or their classification results are unreliable. The unreliable results are due to the limitations in the existing methods which either lack solid probabilistic-based criteria to evaluate the confidence of their taxonomic assignments, or use nucleotide k-mer frequency as the proxy for sequence similarity measurement. RESULTS: We have developed a method that shows significantly improved species-level classification results over existing methods. Our method calculates true sequence similarity between query sequences and database hits using pairwise sequence alignment. Taxonomic classifications are assigned from the species to the phylum levels based on the lowest common ancestors of multiple database hits for each query sequence, and further classification reliabilities are evaluated by bootstrap confidence scores. The novelty of our method is that the contribution of each database hit to the taxonomic assignment of the query sequence is weighted by a Bayesian posterior probability based upon the degree of sequence similarity of the database hit to the query sequence. Our method does not need any training datasets specific for different taxonomic groups. Instead only a reference database is required for aligning to the query sequences, making our method easily applicable for different regions of the 16S rRNA gene or other phylogenetic marker genes. CONCLUSIONS: Reliable species-level classification for 16S rRNA or other phylogenetic marker genes is critical for microbiome research. Our software shows significantly higher classification accuracy than the existing tools and we provide probabilistic-based confidence scores to evaluate the reliability of our taxonomic classification assignments based on multiple database matches to query sequences. Despite its higher computational costs, our method is still suitable for analyzing large-scale microbiome datasets for practical purposes. Furthermore, our method can be applied for taxonomic classification of any phylogenetic marker gene sequences.

abstract = {Motivation: The majority of data generated routinely from various experiments are essentially multivariate, often categorized with multiple experimental metadata. Analyzing such results with interactive visualizations often yields interesting and intuitive results which otherwise remains undisclosed. Results: In this paper, we present Web-Igloo-a GUI based interactive 'feature decomposition independent' multivariate data visualization platform. Web-Igloo is likely to be a valuable contribution in the field of visual data mining, especially for researchers working with but not limited to multi-omics data. To demonstrate its utility, we have used a metagenomic dataset pertaining to the effect of multiple doses of antibiotic treatment on the human gut microbiome.

@article{Lakhujani2017,
abstract = {QIIME (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology) is one of the most popular open-source bioinformatics suite for performing metagenome, 16S rRNA amplicon and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) data analysis. Although, it is very comprehensive and powerful tool, it lacks a method to provide publication ready taxonomic pie charts. The script plot{\_}taxa{\_}summary.py bundled with QIIME generate a html file and a folder containing taxonomic pie chart and legend as separate images. The images have randomly generated alphanumeric names. Therefore, it is difficult to associate the pie chart with the legend and the corresponding sample identifier. Even if the option to have the legend within the html file is selected while executing plot{\_}taxa{\_}summary.py, it is very tedious to crop a complete image (having both the pie chart and the legend) due to unequal image sizes. It requires a lot of time to manually prepare the pie charts for multiple samples for publication purpose. Moreover, there are chances of error while identifying the pie chart and legend pair due to random alphanumeric names of the images. To bypass all these bottlenecks and make this process efficient, we have developed a python based program, prepare{\_}taxa{\_}charts.py, to automate the renaming, cropping and merging of taxonomic pie chart and corresponding legend image into a single, good quality publication ready image. This program not only augments the functionality of plot{\_}taxa{\_}summary.py but is also very fast in terms of CPU time and user friendly.},

@article{Foster2017,
abstract = {Community-level data, the type generated by an increasing number of metabarcoding studies, is often graphed as stacked bar charts or pie graphs that use color to represent taxa. These graph types do not convey the hierarchical structure of taxonomic classifications and are limited by the use of color for categories. As an alternative, we developed metacoder, an R package for easily parsing, manipulating, and graphing publication-ready plots of hierarchical data. Metacoder includes a dynamic and flexible function that can parse most text-based formats that contain taxonomic classifications, taxon names, taxon identifiers, or sequence identifiers. Metacoder can then subset, sample, and order this parsed data using a set of intuitive functions that take into account the hierarchical nature of the data. Finally, an extremely flexible plotting function enables quantitative representation of up to 4 arbitrary statistics simultaneously in a tree format by mapping statistics to the color and size of tree nodes and edges. Metacoder also allows exploration of barcode primer bias by integrating functions to run digital PCR. Although it has been designed for data from metabarcoding research, metacoder can easily be applied to any data that has a hierarchical component such as gene ontology or geographic location data. Our package complements currently available tools for community analysis and is provided open source with an extensive online user manual.},

However, computation times and algorithmic inaccuracies have hindered adoption. RESULTS: We present Taxonomer, an ultrafast, web-tool for comprehensive metagenomics data analysis and interactive results visualization. Taxonomer is unique in providing integrated nucleotide and protein-based classification and simultaneous host messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript profiling. Using real-world case-studies, we show that Taxonomer detects previously unrecognized infections and reveals antiviral host mRNA expression profiles. To facilitate data-sharing across geographic distances in outbreak settings, Taxonomer is publicly available through a web-based user interface. CONCLUSIONS: Taxonomer enables rapid, accurate, and interactive analyses of metagenomics data on personal computers and mobile devices.},

This is often performed using one of four taxonomic classifications, namely SILVA, RDP, Greengenes or NCBI. It is unclear how similar these are and how to compare analysis results that are based on different taxonomies. RESULTS: We provide a method and software for mapping taxonomic entities from one taxonomy onto another. We use it to compare the four taxonomies and the Open Tree of life Taxonomy (OTT). CONCLUSIONS: While we find that SILVA, RDP and Greengenes map well into NCBI, and all four map well into the OTT, mapping the two larger taxonomies on to the smaller ones is problematic.},

@article{Holmes2012,
abstract = {We introduce Dirichlet multinomial mixtures (DMM) for the probabilistic modelling of microbial metagenomics data. This data can be represented as a frequency matrix giving the number of times each taxa is observed in each sample. The samples have different size, and the matrix is sparse, as communities are diverse and skewed to rare taxa. Most methods used previously to classify or cluster samples have ignored these features. We describe each community by a vector of taxa probabilities. These vectors are generated from one of a finite number of Dirichlet mixture components each with different hyperparameters. Observed samples are generated through multinomial sampling. The mixture components cluster communities into distinct 'metacommunities', and, hence, determine envirotypes or enterotypes, groups of communities with a similar composition. The model can also deduce the impact of a treatment and be used for classification. We wrote software for the fitting of DMM models using the 'evidence framework' (http://code.google.com/p/microbedmm/). This includes the Laplace approximation of the model evidence. We applied the DMM model to human gut microbe genera frequencies from Obese and Lean twins. From the model evidence four clusters fit this data best. Two clusters were dominated by Bacteroides and were homogenous; two had a more variable community composition. We could not find a significant impact of body mass on community structure. However, Obese twins were more likely to derive from the high variance clusters. We propose that obesity is not associated with a distinct microbiota but increases the chance that an individual derives from a disturbed enterotype. This is an example of the 'Anna Karenina principle (AKP)' applied to microbial communities: disturbed states having many more configurations than undisturbed. We verify this by showing that in a study of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) phenotypes, ileal Crohn's disease (ICD) is associated with a more variable community.},

@article{Kremen1992,
abstract = {The diversity of organisms and complexity of ecosystems prevent through inventory and monitoring of protected areas, yet sound databases are needed to manage ecosystems for long-term persistence. One strategy is therefore to focus monitoring on indicator organisms, but guidelines are lacking for selecting appropriate species or groups. This paper presents a simple protocol based on ordination techniques for establishing the indicator properties of a group of organisms and for selecting an indicator species subset for more intensive monitoring. Use of ordination allows inclusion of many more taxa than have been traditionally used for natural areas monitoring, and need not rely on detailed knowledge of species biology. As an example, I studied the indicator properties of a butterfly taxocene in a rain forest in Madagascar. Butterflies have been suggested as particularly good environmental indicators due to their sensitivity to micro-climate and light level changes, and their interactions as larvae and adults with different sets of host plants. The indicator properties of butterfly assemblages were evaluated in this study with respect to a known pattern of environmental heterogeneity along topographic/moisture and disturbance gradients. Butterfly assemblages were found to be excellent indicators of heterogeneity due to the topographic/moisture gradient, limited indicators of heterogeneity due to anthropogenic disturbance, and poor indicators of plant diversity. The protocol defined in this study is widely applicable to other groups of organisms, spatial scales, and environmental gradients. By examining the environmental correlates of the distribution of species assemblages, this protocol can assess the indicator properties of target species groups.},

@article{White2009,
abstract = {Numerous studies are currently underway to characterize the microbial communities inhabiting our world. These studies aim to dramatically expand our understanding of the microbial biosphere and, more importantly, hope to reveal the secrets of the complex symbiotic relationship between us and our commensal bacterial microflora. An important prerequisite for such discoveries are computational tools that are able to rapidly and accurately compare large datasets generated from complex bacterial communities to identify features that distinguish them.We present a statistical method for comparing clinical metagenomic samples from two treatment populations on the basis of count data (e.g. as obtained through sequencing) to detect differentially abundant features. Our method, Metastats, employs the false discovery rate to improve specificity in high-complexity environments, and separately handles sparsely-sampled features using Fisher's exact test. Under a variety of simulations, we show that Metastats performs well compared to previously used methods, and significantly outperforms other methods for features with sparse counts. We demonstrate the utility of our method on several datasets including a 16S rRNA survey of obese and lean human gut microbiomes, COG functional profiles of infant and mature gut microbiomes, and bacterial and viral metabolic subsystem data inferred from random sequencing of 85 metagenomes. The application of our method to the obesity dataset reveals differences between obese and lean subjects not reported in the original study. For the COG and subsystem datasets, we provide the first statistically rigorous assessment of the differences between these populations. The methods described in this paper are the first to address clinical metagenomic datasets comprising samples from multiple subjects. Our methods are robust across datasets of varied complexity and sampling level. While designed for metagenomic applications, our software can also be applied to digital gene expression studies (e.g. SAGE). A web server implementation of our methods and freely available source code can be found at http://metastats.cbcb.umd.edu/.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons has facilitated understanding of complex microbial communities, but the inherent noise in PCR and DNA sequencing limits differentiation of closely related bacteria. Although many scientific questions can be addressed with broad taxonomic profiles, clinical, food safety, and some ecological applications require higher specificity. Here we introduce a novel sub-operational-taxonomic-unit (sOTU) approach, Deblur, that uses error profiles to obtain putative error-free sequences from Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq sequencing platforms. Deblur substantially reduces computational demands relative to similar sOTU methods and does so with similar or better sensitivity and specificity. Using simulations, mock mixtures, and real data sets, we detected closely related bacterial sequences with single nucleotide differences while removing false positives and maintaining stability in detection, suggesting that Deblur is limited only by read length and diversity within the amplicon sequences. Because Deblur operates on a per-sample level, it scales to modern data sets and meta-analyses. To highlight Deblur's ability to integrate data sets, we include an interactive exploration of its application to multiple distinct sequencing rounds of the American Gut Project. Deblur is open source under the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license, easily installable, and downloadable from https://github.com/biocore/deblur. IMPORTANCE Deblur provides a rapid and sensitive means to assess ecological patterns driven by differentiation of closely related taxa. This algorithm provides a solution to the problem of identifying real ecological differences between taxa whose amplicons differ by a single base pair, is applicable in an automated fashion to large-scale sequencing data sets, and can integrate sequencing runs collected over time.},

Here we introduce an integrated database, called EzBioCloud, that holds the taxonomic hierarchy of the Bacteria and Archaea, which is represented by quality-controlled 16S rRNA gene and genome sequences. Whole-genome assemblies in the NCBI Assembly Database were screened for low quality and subjected to a composite identification bioinformatics pipeline that employs gene-based searches followed by the calculation of average nucleotide identity. As a result, the database is made of 61 700 species/phylotypes, including 13 132 with validly published names, and 62 362 whole-genome assemblies that were identified taxonomically at the genus, species and subspecies levels. Genomic properties, such as genome size and DNA G+C content, and the occurrence in human microbiome data were calculated for each genus or higher taxa. This united database of taxonomy, 16S rRNA gene and genome sequences, with accompanying bioinformatics tools, should accelerate genome-based classification and identification of members of the Bacteria and Archaea. The database and related search tools are available at www.ezbiocloud.net/.},
